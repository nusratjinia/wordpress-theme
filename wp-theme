Wordpress Installation , Configuration , Theme Selection:
Before installation of wordpress we need LAMP environment.
LAMP:
L=Linux
A=Apache web server
M=MYSQL Database
P=PHP stack
                             Downloading Wordpress

We can download Wordpress straight from their website:

1. wget http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz     (from url)
After downloading wordpress we need to open terminal (Ctrl Alt T) and run the below command to unzip the downloaded folder.
2. tar -xzvf latest.tar.gz

               Creating  WordPress Database and User

After we unzip the wordpress files, there will be in a directory called wordpress in the home directory.
Now we need to create a new MySQL directory for wordpress.
Run the command on terminal.

3. mysql -u root -p
After calling database we need to create a new database by name wordpress and a new user with password. we should run commands on terminal:
4. CREATE DATABASE wordpress;                            (for database)
5 . CREATE USER wordpressuser@localhost;                    (for new user)
6. SET PASSWORD FOR wordpressuser@localhost= PASSWORD("password");   (for password)


Finish up by granting all privileges to the new user. Without this command, the wordpress installer will not be able to start up:

After creating database,database user  we need granting all privileges for the new user. For this we need to run this command:

7. GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* TO wordpressuser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

Then refresh MySQL:
8. FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Exit out of the MySQL shell:
9. exit
                          WordPress Configuration

The first step to is to copy the sample wordpress configuration file, located in the wordpress directory, into a new file which we will edit, creating a new usable wordpress config:
10. cp ~/wordpress/wp-config-sample.php ~/wordpress/wp-config.php
Then open the wordpress config:
11. sudo nano ~/wordpress/wp-config.php
Find the section that contains the field below and substitute in the correct name for your database, username, and password: (database name,username and password that we created for wordpress)
MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host
The name of the database for WordPress
define('DB_NAME', 'wordpress');


MySQL database username
define('DB_USER', 'wordpressuser');

MySQL database password
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'password');
                           Copy the Files
We uploaded wordpress on virtual private server. WE need to move unzipped wordpress
files to the website's root directory.
12. sudo rsync -avP ~/wordpress/ /var/www/
Finally we need to set the permissions on the installation.
13. cd /var/www/

For ownership of the directory to the apache user.
14. sudo chown username:www-data /var/www -R
15. sudo chmod g+w /var/www -R
However, the form does require a specific php module to run. If it is not yet installed on your server, download php-gd:
sudo apt-get install php5-gd

Until this we have done our terminal work. Now we will finalize our wordpress configuration by filling some informations and by log in.

          Complete Installation through the Web Interface

http://server_domain_name_or_IP




You will see the WordPress initial configuration page, where you will create an initial administrator account:


After  filling the informations we need to click install wordpress button:


WordPress will confirm the installation, and then ask you to log in with the account you just created:

Then log in :

After log in:
